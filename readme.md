# Martin Blondins Vimrc and friends

This repository contains my .vimrc and colourscheme along with a setup
script that links the files and installs my plugins.

The setup script is destructive and removes old files.

Theres also some tmux magic going on where i make a function called
work-tmux in my .bashrc and it opens a tmux window with 
[gtd by Connor Mcdaniel](https://github.com/connermcd/gtd),
a clock, a empty terminal, and nautilus on the current directory

# TODO

make startup script less destructive and add a cleanup script for
one time use.
