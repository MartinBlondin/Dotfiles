omnisharp-emacs is a port of the awesome [omnisharp-roslyn][] server to the
Emacs text editor. It provides IDE-like features for editing files in
C# solutions in Emacs, provided by an OmniSharp server instance that
works in the background.

Note that C# syntax highlighting and indenting is provided by [`csharp-mode`](https://github.com/josteink/csharp-mode) which is a dependency of this 
package. See [Configuration](#configuration) section below on how to enable
`omnisharp-mode` via the `csharp-mode` hook.

This package is licensed under GNU General Public License version 3, 
or (at your option) any later version.


## Features
Please see [omnisharp-emacs Features](doc/features.md). Please note that information
on the Features page is outdated and some commands are not ported to the new roslyn
version of `omnisharp-emacs` yet.


## Package Installation
This package requires Emacs 24.4 and above. It has been tested on
Ubuntu, Windows 7+ and on macOS.


### External Dependencies
You may need to have one or more of .NET SDKs (and mono â€“ on UNIX platforms)
installed for your project to be properly processed by  omnisharp server. 

Note that multiple .NET SDKs can be installed in parallel, too.

See:
 - [.NET (Core) SDKs](https://www.microsoft.com/net/targeting)
 - [mono project](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)


### Installation on Spacemacs
Add `csharp` layer to `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` on your `.spacemacs`
file and restart Emacs or run `dotspacemacs/sync-configuration-layers` (`SPC f e R`
in evil mode, `M-m f e R` in Emacs mode).
`csharp-mode` and `omnisharp` packages will get installed automatically for you
as the configuration is reloaded.


### Installation on Regular Emacs
To install, use [MELPA][].
After MELPA is configured correctly, use

<pre>
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
M-x package-install RET omnisharp RET
</pre>
to install.

When installing the `omnisharp` package `package.el` will also 
automatically pull in `csharp-mode` for you as well.

You can also add
```
(package-install 'omnisharp)
```
to your `init.el` to force installation of `omnisharp-emacs` on
every install.


## Configuration
This section describes an example configuration for `omnisharp-emacs`.
This is not required if you are using spacemacs unless you want to 
override existing bindings, etc.

### Applying omnisharp-mode and auto-starting server when visiting C# files
Add this to `csharp-mode-hook` to your `init.el` to automatically invoke
`omnisharp-emacs` when opening C# files:
```
(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'omnisharp-mode)
```

`omnisharp-emacs` will attempt to start a server automatically for you when
opening a .cs file (if a server has not been started already). Otherwise, you
will need to start the server with `M-x omnisharp-start-omnisharp-server RET`
should it fail to find a .sln file or project root (via projectile). It will
prompt you for a solution file or project root directory you want to work
with.

### Autocompletion
For autocompletion via [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode)
mode to work you will also need this in your `init.el`:
```
(eval-after-load
 'company
 '(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-omnisharp))

(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook #'company-mode)
```

### Flycheck
`omnisharp-emacs` supports [Flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck)
and it can be enabled automatically by hooking up `flycheck-mode` to be enabled
for `csharp-mode` buffers:

```
(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook #'flycheck-mode)
```

### Combined setup example

This is an example code that will enable `company-mode` and `flycheck-mode`
and will set some formatting variables for `csharp-mode`. Also, it shows how
to setup keybindings for `csharp-mode`.

```
(eval-after-load
  'company
  '(add-to-list 'company-backends #'company-omnisharp))

(defun my-csharp-mode-setup ()
  (omnisharp-mode)
  (company-mode)
  (flycheck-mode)

  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
  (setq c-syntactic-indentation t)
  (c-set-style "ellemtel")
  (setq c-basic-offset 4)
  (setq truncate-lines t)
  (setq tab-width 4)
  (setq evil-shift-width 4)

  ;csharp-mode README.md recommends this too
  ;(electric-pair-mode 1)       ;; Emacs 24
  ;(electric-pair-local-mode 1) ;; Emacs 25

  (local-set-key (kbd "C-c r r") 'omnisharp-run-code-action-refactoring)
  (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c") 'recompile))

(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-setup t)
```

There is also an example configuration for evil-mode included in the project,
please see `doc/example-config-for-evil-mode.el`.


## Server Installation
This emacs package requires the [omnisharp-roslyn][] server program.
Emacs will manage connection to the server as a subprocess.

The easiest/default way to install the server is to invoke 
`M-x omnisharp-install-server` and follow instructions on minibufer.

If that fails (or you feel adventurous) please see 
[installing omnisharp server](doc/server-installation.md) on how to install the
server manually.


## Troubleshooting
Most of the time (if the server has been installed properly) you can diagnose
issues by looking at the `*omnisharp-log*` buffer where `omnisharp-emacs` emits
any log messages from the omnisharp server.


### Missing .NET SDKs
You may find that your project can not be loaded when .NET SDK is not installed 
on your machine.

A log line indicating the problem would look like this on `*omnisharp-log*`:
```
[19:24:59] WARNING: Microsoft.Build.Exceptions.InvalidProjectFileException: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk' specified could not be found. ...
```
